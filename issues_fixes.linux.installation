1. Can't install Kali Linux from USB, fails to find CD-ROM drive
    Create the directory cdrom directly on the root of the file system:

    $ mkdir /cdrom

    Note : If you got problems making the directory /cdrom, disable the CD-rom player in BIOS or disconnect the cable
    Mount the USB as if it is a CD-ROM:

    $ mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /cdrom
