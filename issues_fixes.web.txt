1. php.ini
	# php -i | grep "Loaded Configuration File"
		Loaded Configuration File => /etc/php5/cli/php.ini

2. Max upload size error in CMS (such as wordpress)
    sol: edit php.ini
	    - upload_size

3. Timeout during CMS installation
     sol: edit php.ini
	    - set max_execution_time = 30 to larger value

4. Set Include Path in PHP
  
    Example #1 set_include_path() example
      <?php
      // Works as of PHP 4.3.0
      set_include_path('/usr/lib/pear');
      
      // Works in all PHP versions
      ini_set('include_path', '/usr/lib/pear');
      ?>
    
    Example #2 Adding to the include path
    
    Making use of the PATH_SEPARATOR constant, it is possible to extend the include path regardless of the operating system.
    In this example we add /usr/lib/pear to the end of the existing include_path.
      <?php
      $path = '/usr/lib/pear';
      set_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . $path);
      ?>

5. Fatal error: Call to a member function bind_param() on boolean
    - A column is set to NULL without being declared so or with default value.
    - VALUES(?,?,?...) in the the PHP code might be lesser or greater than required.

6. Warning: mysqli_stmt::bind_param(): Number of variables doesn't match number of parameters in prepared statement
  Causes:
    - There might be single quotes around placeholders (i.e ?), which will turn out to be values not
       placeholders any longer.
  
  Solution:
    - Remove those single quotes.
