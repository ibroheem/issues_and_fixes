1. Download Speed
	A. For temporary limits, add the -o flag to your apt-get command:
	sudo apt-get -o Acquire::http::Dl-Limit=25 install <package>

	For permanent throttling, create the file /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/75lowerspeed and save the following in it:
Acquire
{
   Queue-mode "access";
   http
   {
      Dl-Limit "25";
   };
};

	Both methods limits apt-get to 25 kBps (kilobytes per second).

1b. Installing i386 Packages : Debian, Ubuntu
    sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
    synaptic->"side pane"->architecture->i386
    to install i386 packages

1c. Release configuration problem with Synaptic Package Manager
    E: The value 'lucid' is invalid for APT::Default-Release as such a release is not  available in the sources E: _cache->open() failed, please report.
    
    Cause(s):
         1. You Probably move, delete ... the contents of /var/lib/apt/lists 
    
    Sol: 1. By removing /root/.synaptic/lock
         2. By editing /root/.synaptic/synaptic.conf
                edit the   DefaultDistro "your_distro" to   DefaultDistro "";
         3. By removing /root/.synaptic/synaptic.conf
                rm /root/.synaptic/synaptic.conf in the root account.
    SOLUTIONS ARE TO BE TRIED IN THE ORDER THEY APPAER
    
2. mintsources conflicts with software-properties and that conflict is explicitly described to APT. That's ok.

	mintsources doesn't provide the functionality given by software-properties though, so if something like Muon depends on it, it is normal for that package not to be installable.

	Although I don't recommend it, you can remove mintsources and proceed to install Muon and software-properties. You just have to choose between one tech or the other though, you can't have both installed on the same machine.

Issues: On opening software-properties-kde/gtk, (this occurs on ubuntu clones esp. linuxmint)
	-Error: could not find a distribution template for LinuxMint/qiana
	Solution: gksu leafpad /etc/*release, modify the values to the current OS's 
	
3. Fix broken Packages
	sudo apt-get -f install
	
4.  explore ftp server in explorer 
	explorer ftp://192.168.43.1:3721

5. to_string() is not a member of std in MinGW
	This could be caused by one of the following:
		i.  Not Enabling The C++0x or C++11 Standard. Use the --std=c++11 or --std=c++11 flag or greater
		Solution: add the necessary flags --std=c++11, --std=c++11, --std=c++1y, --std=c++14, ...
		
		ii. using to_sting() without namespace declaration or specifier e.g:
			declaration: using namespace std; or using std::to_sting;
		Solution:
			- add the necessary namespace declaration i.e 
				using namespace std; Or using std
		
	  	iii.Usually disabled by MinGW developers. Download this Patch: http://tehsausage.com/mingw-to-string
			This patch enables the following list of C++11 functions and templates in the std namespace:
			stoi, stol, stoul, stoll, stof, stod, stold, to_string, to_wstring

		This assumes you are using the official MinGW distribution.
		If you are applying this patch to a version of MinGW GCC later than 4.7, you should examine and apply the patches 				rather than using the zip file.
		
		* Download mingw-to-string-gcc47.zip which contains three patched header files.
		(Original patches: wchar.h, stdio.h, os_defines.h)
		
		* Copy wchar.h and stdio.h from the include directory in the zip file to the following directory (overwrite):
		C:\mingw\include
		(replace C:\mingw\ with the appropriate directory)
		
		* Copy os_defines.h to the following directory (overwrite):
		C:\mingw\lib\gcc\mingw32\4.7.0\include\c++\mingw32\bits
		(replace C:\mingw\ with the appropriate directory)
		(replace 4.7.0 with the correct version number)

6. Making Symlinks on windows
	There are 2 ways to give this privileges to users: 
	1. Start gpedit.msc, go down to "Windows Settings"->"Security Settings"->"Local Policies"->"User Rights Assignment", then find "Create symbolic links" and add whatever users and groups you want.
	
	2. If you have cygwin running: "editrights -a SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege -a user" should work." â€“  Fred Simon Jul 27 '11 at 0:28
   	 
	Example C:\Users\freds>mklink test-6.txt test.txt 
	You do not have sufficient privilege to perform this operation. (And it works great as administrator...)

7. 32-bit soft on 64-bit
        a- install libc:i386, libstdc++6:i386, libncurses6:i386
        b- install ia32-libs

8. Eclipse Closing in Kde on Project Creation Launch
    This is a bug in oxygen theme of Some  Ubuntu Versions
    1. edit /usr/share/themes/oxygen-gtk/gtk-2.0/gtkrc
       GtkComboBox::appears-as-list = 1 to GtkComboBox::appears-as-list = 0 
    
    2. The gtk2-engines-oxygen solves this in older Ubuntu Releases such as Vivid Vervet 15.04
    
9. Updating Specific Repository : apt
    You must create the .list file where the description of the repository will be, ie:

    deb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian raring contrib

    Then save it somewhere. Now you only have to do:

    sudo apt-get update -o Dir::Etc::sourcelist="mysources.list
    
    b. install y-ppa-manager, Y PPA Manager comes with a command line tool called update-ppa that lets you update a single PPA.
        usage : sudo update-ppa ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8

10. Setting git proxy : git config --global http.proxy 127.0.0.1:8087
